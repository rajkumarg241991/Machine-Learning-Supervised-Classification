# Machine-Learning-Supervised-Classification
Machine learning models to predict e-commerce visitors
Result Analysis & Discussion:
In this project, we used the method of models as the classification of our model for best 
prediction. We pre-processed our raw data and obtained trained datasets from which SVM, RF 
and LR were applied. We can conclude the following after analyzing our outcomes:
1. We got no improvement in the Accuracy Score after Random Forest Classifier 
implementation, but a slight increase in Precision and f-1 score.
2. After implementing Logistic Regression to our trained dataset, we got changes in all 
aspects, Accuracy Score, Precision, Recall and f-1 score.
3. We obtained no change in Accuracy Score, Precision, and f-1 score after implementing 
the Support Vector Machine in our model, but only a slight decrease in Recall.
4. After evaluating all the results, we can conclude that the best fit for our given dataset is 
the Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression.
